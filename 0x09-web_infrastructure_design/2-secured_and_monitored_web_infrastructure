Secure three server web infrastructure

Specifics about this infrastructure:
3 firewalls:
The purpose of the firewalls will be to secure the three servers and 
protect them from cyber attacks, preventing unauthorized access of 
critical data.

1 SSL certificate:
The SSL certificate will ensure that our data is encrypted when the 
server and client communicate. The data will be transmitted via the 
HTTPS protocol and not HTTP.

3 monitoring clients:
Monitoring clients will gather data about the system performance and 
help in identifying bottlenecks and potential errors in the system.

Issues with this infrastructure:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer:
Terminating the SSL at the load balancer is risky because traffic 
between the load balance and the servers will be unencrypted

Having one MySQL server capable of accepting write:
This will become a SPOF because if the server fails to write and 
update the records the system will have failed.

Servers with all the same components:
This limits how quickly the system can scale and also identify and fix 
issues. It is easier to set up servers dedicated to only one task. 
This will also make it easier to identify the source of errors.
