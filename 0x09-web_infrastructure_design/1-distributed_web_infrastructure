Three server web infrastructure:

Specifics about this infrastructure:
2 additional servers:
Additional servers will be required to help with scalability, 
redundancy and make the system more robust and fault tolerant.

Web server:
Handle incoming traffic and serve the required content.

Application server:
Deliver dynamic content and allow clients to interact with the business logic.

Load balancer:
Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing network traffic 
across a group of servers. This is necessary in our design since we 
have more than one server. This helps in scaling up in a cost 
effective manner, ensures that no one server is overworked, redundancy 
and improves flexibility.

Distribution algorithm:
It uses a least connection distribution algorithm. This works by 
sending a new request to the server with the fewest current 
connections to clients.

Load balancer setup:
It's configured to an active-active setup which is made up of at least 
2 noded running simultaneously. This means that all three servers will 
be active. This differs from the active-passive setup which requires 
one server to be on standby in case the primary server fails.

MySQL Database:
An additional database is required to act as the replica database. The 
primary node also known as the master node accepts writes while the 
replica node can only process read-only transactions. This will ensure 
there are no data conflicts, provide fault tolerance and load 
splitting.

Issues with this infrastructure:
SPOF:
The single point of failure will be the load balancer. If it fails the 
client will be unable to access the website.

Security issues:
There are no firewalls and incoming traffic is not secure and it's 
also unencrypted meaning that it can be intercepted.

No monitoring:
Other lurking bottlenecks and issues have not been identified since 
there is no monitoring.
